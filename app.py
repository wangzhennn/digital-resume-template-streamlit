st.write("09/2022 - 02/2024 | Under SSCI Journal Review")
st.write("Time theft has become a growing issue in organizations, notably due to the rapid shift to remote work prompted by the pandemic. Existing studies demonstrate both authoritarian leadership and laissez-faire leadership can exacerbate time theft, putting leaders in a behavioral dilemma of neither being strict nor lenient. Additionally, the pervasive and covert nature of time theft diminishes the effectiveness of afterward corrective actions. Our study aims to investigate how to prevent time theft by mitigating employees‚Äô inclinations. Based on role theory, our study examines if supervisor developmental feedback can encourage employees to perform work roles more appropriately. To uncover the complicated internalization process of role expectation, our study incorporates perceived insider status and work passion as serial mediators and considers the boundary effect of leaders‚Äô word-deed consistency. In Study 1, a survey of 483 employees revealed that supervisor developmental feedback can negatively predict employee time theft through employees‚Äô perceived insider status and work passion. Study 2 further identifies three topics of supervisor developmental feedback: skill learning, attitude learning, and social learning. Moreover, serial multiple mediating effects are affirmed across topics. The findings suggest that providing feedback information on employees‚Äô learning and growth is an effective approach to prevent time theft")

Using a sample of 194 Chinese family firms from 2007 to 2019, our findings suggest that inside CEOs perform better than outside CEOs in family firms‚Äô innovative performance.
